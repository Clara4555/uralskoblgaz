                Environmental assessment of the efficiency of the production process within the framework of industrial environmental control is carried out on the basis of measurements and (or) calculations of the level of emissions into the environment, harmful production factors, as well as the actual volume of consumption of natural, energy and other resources.
                One of the main elements of the Industrial Environmental Control Program is industrial monitoring of environmental objects.
